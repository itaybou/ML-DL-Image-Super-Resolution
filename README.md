# ML-DL-Image-Super-Resolution 

## Problem Statement
The purpose of this assignment is to get familiar with construction and training of fully convolutional networks.
We will specifically use the task of image super-resolution, and weâ€™ll construct several different architectures and compare the results achieved by each of them.
